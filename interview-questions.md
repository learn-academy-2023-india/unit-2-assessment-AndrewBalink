# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: 
    - A parameter is a variable in the declaration of a function.
    - Arguments are the values passed to the function when it is called. 

Researched answer: 
    - A parameter is a variable in the declaration of a function. Parameters act as placeholders that represent the values that will be input to the function when it is called. An example is: "add(a,b)". "a" and "b" are the parameters used within the function body to perform additon. 
    -An argument is the actual value that gets passed into the function when it is called. An example is: "add(1,2)". "1" and "2" are the arguments as they are the actual values used in place of the parameters. 

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: 
    - Objects are a JavaScript data type that have a colection of key-value pairs. They can contain static information and actions in the form of methods.Objects are the intersection of data and behavior.
    - Classes are the "blue print" template for objects. They are customizable and reusable like functions. 

Researched answer:
    - An object is an instance that contains a set of key value pairs. The values may consist of properties and methods and can contain any JavaScript data type. An example is a person, having properties (name, age, eye color) and abilities (standing, walking, talking). These properties and abilities are represented as key-value pairs and functions. 
    - A class is a blue print or a template for creating objects. It defines what properties and methods an object should have. 

3. What is iteration?

Your answer:
    - Iteration is the process of executing a block of code over and over until a condition is met. 

Researched answer:
    - Iteration refers to the process of executing a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Iteration is typically accomplished by using loops. JavaScript also allows for iterating over arrays and objects by using ".map()" and ".filter()". Iteration is a fundamental concept in programming, as it allows developers the ability to automate repetitive tasks and to handle large sets of data efficiently. 

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: 
    - Hoisting is a behavior in which the variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase, before the code is executed. It allows for the use of a function or variable before being declared. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: A React data structure used to store data within a React component. Data stored in state is available to the entire React component.

2. React Props: Specialized React objects used to pass information from one component to another. Props create a unidirectional flow of data and behavior from one component down to a nested component via the component invocation. Props cannot be changed as they are a "read only" value. 

3. JSX: A markdown syntax extension to JavaScript. It is a JavaScript flavored markdown that acts similarly to HTML. JSX is a building block of React components and is what allows React to create user interfaces.
